```


## Part 2. Problems

### Problem 1. Personal data 

#### a. Data summarizing 

I could count the number of service calls where help was or wasnâ€™t needed, grouped by whether the light was working or broken. Comparing these groups is informative because a broken light might influence whether guests mistakenly request help.

#### b. Visualizations

```{r data cleaning}

# Clean and standardize help and working columns

clean_service_data <- service_data |>  # using service_data set
  mutate(
    # Convert values to uppercase to avoid issues with lowercase na
    help = toupper(help),
    working = toupper(working),
    # Convert the uppercase text to logical TRUE/FALSE values
     help = as.logical(help), 
    working = as.logical(working))


```
